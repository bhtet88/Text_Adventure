### Backstory ###

opening = """{0}, you have worked long and hard, preparing countless months for this journey. You know you are close to the heart of the ancient yet mysterious city of Seduco. 
Countless adventurers have lost their lives attempting to reach the treasure of the city. Legend says that thousands of years ago the Romans experimented with sorcery and alchemy 
in an attempt to find an elixer for immortality. Ancient scriptures say that in they invented divine weapons and technology during this pursuit, inventions lost in time. You have no idea
what this journey will entail or if you will even manage to come back alive. However, you know that if you find even just one of the treasures of Seduco, you will be set for life. You don't
expect to find anyone else on your journey to help you. It is just up to you, your equipment, and your wits."""

store_intro = """Before you embark on your adventure and leave the comforts of civilization, you head to the local store in order to purchase and finalize your gear. You have a backpack that can carry up to {0} lbs and
a wallet of {1} coins. Prepare wisely adventurer! Who knows when's the next time you can buy what you want?"""

### Village ### 

village_arrive = """After getting your supplies, you take a bus to a small, quiet village in the rural outskirts of the city. It's a quiet place with the villagers living simple but contentful lives. You see animals grazing off in the distance as farmers watch over them.
A group of children are playing games in the village square. Some friendly dogs join in their game, eagerly wanting to have their share of the fun as well. People are walking around the small village, going about their daily lives and ignoring your humble presence."""

village_depart = """No matter. You have everything you need for your journey. After talking with some of the locals about the legends of the ancient city, they point you to a well-trodden dirt road leading out of the village. Their eyes always widen with fear when you mention your intentions.
Many travelers have gone down this path yet none have returned. The village priest whispers his prayers for your safe return and the village elder gives you a final farewell before you trek down this path. The elder also hands you a knife and a sturdy rope, just in case."""

early_end = """You've come this far but as you look down at the village, you think about what kind of terrors previous adventurers faced. How many ran out of food and water, dying a slow and painful death? Who knows what perils are up ahead? A hostile people? Wild, aggressive animals? 
Deadly traps created by unknown people? Just thinking about these dangers makes your heart race. Life is too precious to risk your life to acquire treasures based upon mere legend. Maybe it exists, maybe it doesn't. It doesn't matter. You turn around and get back on the bus to the airport.
It's time to go home and end this chapter of your life."""

moving_forward = """Thinking about how much of your life you spent dedicated to this journey, about the fame and fortune you can get if you succeed, you turn your back on the village and move onwards. The only thing on your mind is the way forward. The air is cool and you
are excited for what awaits you. The dirt path is packed tightly, beaten down from the adventurers before you. The slight breeze causes the trees to whistle a small tune to accompany the beat of your footsteps."""

### The Wall ###

the_wall = """After about an hour and a half of walking, taking light breaks along the way, you see a misty wall in front of you. It is a very pale grey and towers over you. The only noise is that of the wind. Moving forward seems like the right option but 
you also can't help feel anxiety overcome you. Is this wall the reason why adventurers before you never came back? Is there even a way for you return once you cross this mystical shroud? You stand there in wonder, thinking about what to do next."""

wall_boomerang = """Using your mighty arms, you throw the boomerang through the mist. It glistens as the moisture engulfs it and then, it disappears. A few seconds go by, only for the boomerang to emerge from the mist. Having completed it's mission, it safely returns to your hands. You wipe
off the moisture on it but other than that, it looks just like how it did before you threw it. You then put it back into your backpack, still pondering what to do next."""

wall_rope = """The rope is nice, sturdy, and very long. You pull out a long section of rope and throw it into the mist, then drag it back out. Aside from some moisture on the parts of the rope that went into the wall, there is no damage to the rope at all. You coil the rope back up and put it
back into your backpack, contemplating what to do next."""

wall_end = """Sadly, all these thoughts are too much for you to take. The stress of being an adventurer is overbearing. If you can't muster up the strength to take a step through this shroud, how can you make it past harder obstacles? Perhaps this mist was a blessing, stopping you from 
making such a foolish mistake. You slowly walk back to the village and board a bus back to the airport. It's a sad thought to have spent so much time planning and preparing for this trip, just to turn around when the adventure just began. At least you have a home to look forward to, something
many adventurers can never say again."""

wall_onwards = """Mustering up your courage, you slowly walk towards the mist. You've made up your mind. There is no more turning back anymore! You place your right foot through the mist, then your left. Nothing feels abnormal so far. Continuing to move forwards, the mist feels 
refreshing on your skin, cleansing you of all the sweat accumulated on your trek. A few more steps and then, daylight. You feel the same as before and the forest around you looks the same as that before the wall. What was the purpose of this? How has no one discovered this before? 
Or did they discover it and perish before spreading the news? You move onwards, unaware of the perils up ahead."""

### The Forest ###

first_encounter_1 = """The bushes on your right rustle violently and you hear a distinct clinking noise coupled with the sound of footsteps on packed dirt. Slowly, a gleaming figure walks out in front of you. Clad in armor and a helmet adorned with a feather crown, he stands before you, dagger
in one hand, a massive shield in the other. Golden engravings are beautifully etched into the armor. He has a stern face but you notice something odd, very odd. This man has red eyes that pierce right through you. Before you can think about what to do, he raises right arm up into the sky."""

first_encounter_2 = """He starts moving towards you, covering himself with his shield. It's clear what this man's -- no, he's not a mere man -- Legionary's, intentions are. You said there is no turning back after crossing the mist so it's time to hold your ground and fend off this assailant."""

first_encounter_end = """The Legionary falls, his corpse making a heavy landing on the ground and kicking up small clouds of dust. Shaking, you slowly make your way to his body and examine this being. Why is there a Legionary out of all things here? Yeah sure, you are searching for ancient
Roman treasure but the Western Roman empire's army is a thing of the past. His glowing red eyes have now changed to just look like the eyes of any normal human. All over his skin are scars and features that can be best described as shallow cracks, looking like the cracks in the ground when 
there is extreme heat and no water. Aside from all this, he looks like a normal person. If this guy was so bent on killing you, there has to be something up ahead, some sort of secret, maybe even treasure! You take a few deep breaths and collect yourself together. If this was any indicator,
getting to the lost city is going to be a challenge. This forest that you are in also doesn't help. It's so dense that you find it difficult to see things that are far away. However, you walk forward with a hardened resolve, ready to take on what's up ahead. Looks like the game begins now."""

boss1_intro1 = """After fighting through many enemies, you come into an incredibly dense part of the forest, denser than any region you've previously been in. Branches upon branches cause you to pause and move them out of their way. Eventually, you push past all of the vegetation and 
make it into a large, grassy field. The grass is incredibly green, as if it has been well maintained daily by the care of a professonal gardener. The wind sweeps through the field, causing the blades of grass to dance in unison. There are even some colorful flowers popping out of the ground. 
Despite have to fight for your life, you stand there and take in the scenery, relieved to be taking a pause on your journey. Suddenly, you see sections of grass being flattened, like something is moving through the field out of your sight! You hear the sound of something moving over
dirt and rocks, producing a noticeable crunching noise. You get back on your guard, readying your weapons for whatever happens next. Then, the unexpected happens or perhaps maybe you should suspend your disbelief at this point."""

boss1_intro2 = """A giant snake rises out of the grass in front of you, hissing loudly and rattling its tail. It's death tune makes you turn stone cold. The gigantic, pearl white fangs glisten in the sunlight and you can see drops of venom dripping of them to the ground. This is not like
the enemies you faced before. Should you run? No, its definately faster than you can even sprint. Maybe hide? No, it already sees you and can probably smell you out of the smallest corner. Before you can decide what you will do, the snake charges you. You narrowly dodge its strike by jumping
to the side. This creature seems to want to eat your flesh by tearing you apart. If you're going to get to the lost city, you have no option. You will have to take this beast head on! You steel youself, ready for battle."""

boss1_end = """The snake falls onto the ground dead. That was a tough fight and you can't believe you managed to slay that beast. You are tired but adrenaline is still surging through you. You take a large drink from your canteen, slowly allowing your mind to calm down and regain focus. After
a few minutes, you decide it's time to continue forward. Going across to the other side of the field, you find what looks like skeletons and armor, dented and battered. This snake clearly didn't pick allegiances; both you and the Romans contain flesh. Moving a few feet past, you come across 
what looks like an entrance to a cave or tunnel. No, it's definately a tunnel as you can barely make out the light at the other end, a tiny glowing speck. You take a bit more time to get your gear ready, take out a flashlight, and proceed into the darkness."""

### The Tunnel ###

tunnel_start = """The tunnel is an extremely dark place but you know you have to keep your wits about you. Someone or something hostile could appear anywhere and at anytime. You can barely make out that the walls of the tunnel are a cold, hard granite. It must have been an effort to construct
this tunnel, both in hours and in manpower. The path itself seems more barebones, just a simple dirt path. Despite it being extremely dark, you think about how greatly the beam from your flashlight will give away your position and contemplate lowering its brightness."""

light_lower = """You decide that it's best to dim your flashlight, reducing the beam's brightness to the point where you can just barely make out things two steps ahead. You also make a conscious effort to walk more quietly, taking light steps along the way. However, you start to hear a 
cluster of noises up ahead."""

light_same = """You decide that reducing your vision will only make you more prone to a surprise attack and keep it on its brightness, allowing the beam to carve a path through the darkness. After all, you can probably take on any enemy down here anyways so why put yourself at a disadvantage?
You hear someone shout up ahead. 'Hey, you men see that light! Let's go check that out!' The voice is clearly Latin and you hear the clinking of armor quickly moving towards you. 'It's the adventurer, don't let him past!'"""

tunnel_end = """Leaving the odd merchant behind, you finally reach the light at the end of the tunnel. You give your eyes time to adjust to the light and slowly reopen them. You find yourself at the edge of a cliff and looking down, you see a seemingly infinite drop. To your left, you see a
narrow dirt path, at most a few feet wide. It is the only way for you to progress so you prepare yourself to move forward. While preparing, you wonder how those Legionaries knew about your arrival so soon. You managed to fend off all your attackers in the forest so no one could make it make
to alert others. Maybe they are just used to slaying adventurers? Perhaps as you move further on, you will find out more about this topic. Taking a deep breath, you move towards the narrow path, taking each step with great care."""

### The Cliffs ###

cliffs_intro = """Trying not to look down, you slowly progress forward, step by step. Suddenly, you hear something that is best described as a love child between a screech and a bird's caw. You look up into the clear blue sky, the direction of the sound, and see multiple bird-like creatures
surrounding you. Some have a bow and arrow while others have swords, knifes, or other melee weapons. They all look like female humans with claws for hands and feet and wings growing out of their backs. All of them have extremely long, black hair that complements the thick black feathers on 
their wings. Most of them also appear to have armor on their torso and helmets. One of them dives down towards you but you manage to dodge the attack. Having missed, the creature flies back into the air, looking excited to strike again."""

boss2_intro = """You turn a corner on the cliff path and see a bridge off in the distance ahead of you. On the other side of the bridge appears to be some sort of town. You can just barely make out some of the buildings from the background. Perhaps that is where you need to go next, even if 
its just to rest and get more supplies. In front of you, the path gradually becomes wider and wider, growing to be twice its width. The floor is littered with bird feces and large, loose branches. However, the most noticeable feature in front of you are multiple large circular nests. These 
nests are gigantic, at least twice your height in diameter and are as tall as your waist. Inside are equally large dull grey eggs, each of which are about as tall as you. The surface of the eggs are smooth and each nest has a cluster of them laying there. You also notice bones and worn 
away Legionary armor next to the eggs clusters. It appears that you and the Romans have a common foe. Perhaps these creatures crave flesh from birth. You decide to quickly but quietly try to get past this area before any protective mothers come back. You almost make it across when a large 
shadow flies over you and you hear an earpiercing shreek."""

boss2_intro2 = """You look up to see another one of those bird-like creatures hovering over you. It is about twice as large as the other ones you encountered and its feathers are a bright white, glistening in the sunlight. Its talons look more like daggers, sharper than any blade in existance. 
With every flap of its wings, you feel a gust of wind trying to move you back. It takes all of your might just to stand your ground. If there is anything about pack animals, it's that their leader is the embodiment of all the qualities of their kind. They are always the most fierce, the most 
brave, the most cunning, and the most protective. It seems like this is the alpha for these creatures and you are invading their territory. You know that this will be a fight to the death. You can't outrun it nor hide from it. It is a battle between you, an adventurer trying to just move 
past, and this beast, protecting what's left of its flock."""

boss2_end = """With a final loud screech, the creature plummets down into the endless chasm below. Its feathers fly off of its wings, leaving a trail behind in the sky. Eventually, the body is too far down and vanishes from your sight. You progress forward and make it to the bridge you saw 
earlier. Surprisingly, there is no one at the stone bridge. No guards. None of their crazed dogs. Nothing. You cross the bridge while still keeping your guard up. You look off to the side and take one more look at the endless drop below, wondering how much effort and engineering it took to 
build this bridge. Perhaps the Romans know more than you expected. After all, they did have an amazing form of concrete that no historian or engineer has been able to replicate in the present day. Perhaps if you make it out alive, you can spread this knowledge back to the real world. """

### The Town ### 

town_intro = """Reaching the opposite end of the bridge, you find youself at the edge of a town or city. You see a few large, multistory apartment buildings, the 'insula' if you remember your research correctly, that appear to be almost brand new. Their brick walls show almost no signs of wear 
and there is barely any dust or grim on them. The color on the buildings is still there, creating a mixture of red, white, and gray buildings in front of you. On the bottom floor, it appears that there are signs for shops, blacksmiths, armorers, and other services. On the upper levels, you see 
name plates, leading you to believe that those sections are the living quarters. In front of you, the road turns from a simple dust path to a well made cobblestone lane. You can see places where the lane intersects with other cobblestone paths at 90 degree angles, perhaps making a city with 
perfectly square blocks. An organized city, that is something the Romans definately strived for. The other buildings in front of you also look like more bars, shops, and services. They all look perfectly maintained as well. For a lost city, the Romans are dead set on making this place look 
perfect. If your knowledge of Roman cities serves you right, there should be a main town square or something of the like to help you orientate yourself. However, something disturbs you or rather, the lack of something disturbs you. Where is everyone? You'd think that for a mythical city, there 
would be more people. Someone has to be maintaining these buildings otherwise dust and dirt would get on them or maybe even those bird-like creatures would have made their home here. You stay on your guard and decide to keep pressing onward. Navigating this city will be difficult and having 
people to guide you would have been nice. Perhaps they all ran upon hearing of your impending arrival."""

town_forum = """After what feels like hours of wandering, you make it to the town forum, a large open square near the heart of the city surrounded by various buildings. They all have a similar construction, brick or concrete walls painted white along with red roofs. Some of them are multiple 
stories while others are only one. Once again, all these buildings look very well maintained, as if they were just built right before you arrived. What is even more disturbing is that you have yet to see a single person despite having weaved through multiple blocks of the city. The only sound 
you've heard in the past eternity was your shoes on cobblestone. Off in the distance, you see a large palace, towering over all the other buildings. Next to it is another large building, though not as large, which has large, thick white pillars at the front. It looks like the typical Roman 
building you saw in artist renditions of Rome: sloped roof, multiple white columns in the front, and an overall rectangular shape to the structure. On the columns, there seems to be large purple banners draped from the top of the columns, perhaps marking it as a site of importance to the city. 
Perhaps that is where the treasure of this city are. You make a mental note of both of these locations and pick a road that appears to stretch in their direction. However, as you start moving, your sixth sense begins making you nervous."""

town_ambush = """You look over your shoulder to find soldiers blocking the entrances to the forum behind you. You look forward, prepared to run, but then see more soldiers blocking your way forward. Some look like the Legionaries you faced in the forest but with more armor and polearms 
instead of a shield/dagger loadout. At their feet are also the dogs you saw before but now with armor encasing their body and head. Furthermore, behind each group of infantry is a group of archers, wearing chainmail over a bright red tunic. All your foes have glowing red eyes, an unsettling 
sight. Surrounded on all sides, you know you have to fight your way out. Quickly, you formulate a plan: pick the most weakly defended exit out of the forum, fight past the defenders, and lose the rest by using the city as a maze. You must escape as fast as possible. For whatever reason, 
the Romans really want you dead. They also probably know this city like the back of their hand so this will be difficult."""

town_chase_end = """You manage to sneak into an alley and hear the loud footsteps of your pursuers race past you. It appears like you can slip past them and head towards that gigantic palace. However, it is sort of odd isn't it? They have dogs at their disposal. Surely at least one of them 
could sniff you out by now. You soon have your answer as you hear multiple explosions occur in the region of the town behind you, and then at the portion of the city in front of you. You peek out of the alley you're hiding in to find that the city you have been running through has been almost 
demolished. The buildings have turned into large mounds of rubble, blocking the roads and being too tall for you to scale. In the other direction, a few blocks in front of you have had the same treatment, with rubble blocking your way once again. However, the rest of the city remains as 
perfect as before, creating a noticeable divide between the ruins and the city. A street with a destroyed building on one side had a pristine one on the other. What were the Romans thinking? What kind of secrets are they hiding to justify the destruction of their own city, perhaps the last 
Roman city left on Earth? There is something going on here, something more than just mere riches, fame, and fortune. It appears the Romans have retreated from the area at least so you can relax for a bit."""

town_way_forward = """Moving out of the alley, you notice that there are two paths that remain unblocked by rubble, with the buildings on the edge of the road still standing despite everything else being destroyed. A sign at the intersection writes that the open path to your left goes to the 
'Machine Labs' and the one to your right heads to the 'Mages' Den.'"""

### Event dialogues ###

# Dodge #

dodge_text = """The tunnel is pitch black but you hear sounds approaching you and dive towards the darkest spot you can find. As the sounds come closer, you realize that it is the sound of Legionary armor clinking during motion. You slow down your breathing and cease to move, hiding as still 
as a statue. No matter how nervous you have be, you must be quiet. Clinging to darkness, you patiently wait for the sounds to mvoe past you. All that is protecting you is the darkness of the tunnel. Every second feels like an hour but eventually, the sounds move past you and fade into the 
distance. It is fortunate that their torches are not very bright. Perhaps luck is on yout side. You breath once more, slip out of the darkness, and continue on your path."""

# Statues #

statues_intro = """You walk into a room in a bizzare condition. The walls and floor are polished and clean, aside from a few specks of dirt and grim. Two large pillars lay toppled on the ground in front of you, beautifully etched with engravings of Legionaries marching into battle and of
the Roman people celebrating a good harvest. A red carpet streches across the length of the whole room, from the entrance where you stand all the way to the exit on the other side. Just like the walls, it is also almost immaculate except for the crumbled remains of the pillars on it.
Above you, you notice that the roof has broken down for some reason, causing the sunlight to pour into the room and shower the main attractions: gigantic statues of the legendary {0}, {1}, and {2}. 

You climb over the pillars and walk in front of the statues to examine them. They are expertly crafted and have little signs of wear. It's incredible how they survived so long yet who is maintaining this room? In fact, are you the only person who has made it here? You take out your 
Latin to English dictionary and decipher the worn out messages engraved on the base of each statue. 'Place hand here to...' The rest is suspiciously worn away on each statue. Should you place your hand where it tells you too? What will happen? You stand there, wondering what to do 
as three looming giants judge you with their stone cold gazes."""

mercury = """You walk up to and place your hand at the base of the statue of Mercury bent over in a sprint. An airy feeling overcomes you, making you feel as light as a feather. All the weight of being an adventurer, the stress of fending off creatures for your survival, the doubt of making it 
back home in one piece is lifted off of your shoulders. It feels as if you are merely existing but it is an enjoyable kind of existance. Gone with the worries of the world, it seems like you could just enjoy the feeling of being alive! You close your eyes to savor this moment. Slowly, 
this euphoric feeling goes away and you return to reality. You open your eyes and in front of you are a pair of chrome colored boots. You slip them on and immediately notice that they are almost weightless."""

mars = """You walk up to the towering statue of Mars in full armor and place your hand at its polished base. Suddenly, how feel your body heat up to an immense degree. It's hot, painfully hot! The sweat running down your skin feels like a knife being dragged through your skin! You start jumping 
and skipping about the room, intensely wiping off your sweat and screaming at the pain. You close your eyes, you want to die and end this suffering. However, the pain suddenly stops. You open your eyes and gasp for breath. What just happened?! You check your entire body yet there are no signs
of damage and all your clothes have dry as ever. You are relieved. However, you also feel an incredible power inside of you now. It courses through every vessel in your body and you feel stronger than ever."""

apollo = """You walk up to the statue of Apollo singing gracefully with his lyre and place your hand at its base. The one quiet room starts to fill with the sound of ancient Roman singing, slowly becoming louder and louder. A playful rhythm accompanies a steady beat and lyrics about the wonders
of Roman life. The voices sing of a wonderful harvet and plentiful hunt, thanking the Gods for their mercy and blessings. The mystical bard moves on to tell of the glory of the Roman military, how graceful the men march into battle and the mercy they show their foes. The focus then turns to
life in the city, encapsulating with descriptions of the town square, the political discussions occuring in the Senate, and the cheers of the crowd in the Colusseum. The music flows all around you and uplifts your spirit, making it as full of joy as the melody itself. You close your eyes to
turn inwards and fully imagine what the song is saying. Then, the voices and music slowly fade away and you are left in the silence of the room once more. Upon opening your eyes, you find a beautiful lyre in front of you, a treasure for you to keep."""

vejovis = """You walk up to the statue of Vejovis holding pilums standing next to a goat and place your hand at its base. You feel a quick rush of energy overcome you but then it quickly dissipates. However, when you take a drink of your water, you feel more refreshed than you were expecting. 
The same feeling occurs when you try eating a snack from your backpack. Everything you consume invigorates you with more energy than ever before. """

diana = """You walk up to the statue of Diana, crouched aiming her bow, and place your hand at its base. Immediately, you notice a whistle come from behind you and you whip around, ready to take on another foe. However, what was once a white room has now become an expansive forest. You turn
back around to face the statue but that's gone as well, replace by more tall trees and short shrubs. You turn around once more, hearing a rustling in the bushes behind you. Out of the shrubs jumps a large, fat boar that immediately starts grazing in front of you. You don't know what you 
should do. That thing has the speed and strength to rip your guts out with its tusks. Despite being frozen, you notice out of the corner of your right eye a graceful and silent archer crouching next to you. She has a finely crafted bow in hand but no quiver in sight. She sees you and puts her
finger up to her lips. 'Sssshhhh, don't alert him,' she whispers. In one smooth motion, she loads one of her three arrows, draws her bow, and fires it directly into the boar. In rapid succession, she fires her other two. In less than a second, the boar goes down to the ground. The archer gives 
you her thanks for staying quiet and goes forth to secure her kill. The forest vanishes around you and the room returns back to normal. You feel as if you learned something valuable from that experience: how to use a bow to its full potential. A skill that you think will come in handy."""

placing you in the skeleton's shoes but you imagine that this brave and foolish soul stopped moving forward for whatever reason. No more food, water, equipment, willpower, or whatever it may be. You imagine that they just sat down in this room, resting their back on this wall. Perhaps they
cried or thrashed around in anger and frustration. Eventually, they made peace with the idea of death and slowly let their life slip away from them. At least, that is how you would like to die, accepting the end of your life if it came down to this."""

machine. However, this is not just any rifle. It's the Ross Rifle, legendary Canadian bolt action rifle renowned for its accuracy and power! It became known after its performance with Canadian troops during the Great War, becoming a precision weapon in the hands of a skilled user. If only

advance!' At that moment, the ranks behind the front line of Legionaries placed their shields above their heads, forming an inpenetrable fortess of Roman might. They unit slowly creeped towards the barbarians, their shields fending off the arrows. On their flanks, their auxilliary archers
peppered the enemy. When they clashed with the barbarian warriors, the Legionaries showed their skill and strength, cutting down their foes and whittling the enemy's numbers. A charge from their cavalry finished off the survivors, leaving the Romans the victors. You are in awe of their
might and shocked by their determination. The vision fades away and you are left in an empty place. It's a shame that you have to go against these powerful foes. No wonder they were a legendary fighting force. The event left no evidence but left a lasting memory inside you."""

ghosts_run = """Fear has a vice grip on you and your heart is beating as hard as it can. Adrenaline surges through you and your leg muscles are bursting with energy. Whatever is happening, it's best to get out of there! Good or bad or whatever, you don't care enough to find out. But, but, but,
you were here to push on, to move towards the treasure. You summon up all your courage and run through this paranormal scene as fast as you can, dashing out of the room until its exit was out of your sight. Exhausted from that sprint, you lean back on a rock and catch your breath, collecting
youself back together. All you think about is that this treasure better be damn worth it!"""

# Merchant Event #

merchant_intro = """You come across a mysterious figure standing inside in what appears to look like a type of makeshift stand or shop. A sign in the front reads 'Merchant' in Latin but this place also gives a bad feeling. You can't see the merchant's face, shrouded in darkness by the hood
over their head. The inside of the shop is extremely dark as well, allowing you to only see the merchant leaning over the front counter. Even though there's light all around you, it's as if the light is averted once it attempts to enter the shop. Despite the peculiar nature of this shop, 
the likes of which you've never seem before, the merchant notices your presence and gestures for you to come over. 'Weeeeeelcome traveler, needs some...wares?' said a gruff, crackled voice. Even the way this merchant spoke sounds like someone trying to lure you into a back alley to rob
you. But this may also be the only chance you have to resupply on your travels, especially in a place so removed from normal civilization."""

# Encounters #

abandoned_village = """You come across a small collection of worn down houses. It is eerily quiet, not even the sound of the wind could be heard. You guess that this place is some sort of village or encampment. However, the most defining feature of a place like this was missing: the people.
There is not a soul in sight. Not even any of the bizzare enemies or creatures you have encountered, if those even have a soul in the first place. The buildings seem to be made of a bricks made from mud, some of which had visible cracks and were crumbling. They were all an extremely dull
gray-brown, adding to your uneasiness. However, you are an adventurer and explorer so your curiosity gets the better of you and you slowly explore the buildings, one by one. You remain on guard, ready for anything that could happen. However, you slowly become more and more relieved. There 
really is no one here. However, the homes look lived in, very well lived in. There is food, cooking equipment, tables, beds, and anything else you'd expect. In one of the houses, you find food that is still warm but you don't dare try to eat it. Whoever was here left this place in a hurry 
and very recently too. Was this the encampment of those Romans you were fighting? Or maybe this was home to civilians who recieved word of your impending arrival and ran away? There is no sign of violence either, making you believe that their departure probably wasn't due to a local or 
domestic problem. Regardless, you leave everything as it was and prepare to move on."""

water = """You come across a river, with crystal clear water, clear enough to where you can perfectly see the pebbles at the bottom. The water is very calm, slowly flowing past you. After all you have been through, refreshing water is what you need. You cup water into your hands and wash your
face and body, trying to rinse off the grim, dirt, and blood on you. You eagerly fill up your canteen and then take massive glups from it, enjoying the slightly sweet water rejuvinating your body and mind. You take this time to quickly wash your dirty equipment too, especially your weapons. 
Once satisfied with your break, you get back on your feet and prepare to move on."""
