You see an entire row of prison cells directly across from you, streching for at least 10 cells as far as you can see in your limited perspective. Reasonably, you assume that there is an equally long row of cells on your side as well. The hallways in the middle is dimmly lit by lights that create a light blue hue to the entire area. The walls of both your cell and the hallway are made of large, white tiles that, when combined with the light, create a turquoise colored environment. Despite it being a prison, you see that there is next to no trash or litter or dirt or any other kind of filth anywhere. The hall and the cells are immaculate. Even the uniform you are wearing and that of your fellow prisoners is spotless. A clean, orange jumpsuit combined with a white T shirt below it. On the opposite side of the bars, to your right, is a small window that lets in a small ounce of natural light. It is impossible to see out of it so you end up sitting on the cold, hard stone bench, likely a sad excuse for a bed. The only other thing in your cell is a white toilet.

The armor has a belt with multiple yet seemingly empty pouches. At the waist is a utility belt with many pouches attached to it, the most noticeable one having a gray baton sitting inside of it. Their pants continue the aesthetic trend, being black with red accents along the side of the leg. At the bottom of their legs are large, black boots. Their elbows and knees are covered with elbow and knee pads, respectively. On the hands are black gloves with more red accents. Their head is fully enclosed in a large black helmet that has some reflectivity in the light. One side of the helmet has a mounted flashlight.

However, you then enter a long, large room that, like Level C, is one long yet wide corridor. Instead of cells, this place has rows of lab benches, conveyor belts, assembly machines, and other things you would expect for a hub of engineers and scientists. These devices populate the entire room, essentially making it one giant workshop, where teams working on various projects or pieces of the same project can openly communicate. You see the door to the next room at the opposite end of the workshop. Many of the assembly machines have robots or some sort of machine on them, standing tall and motionless. However, as you pass the first set of robots, it suddently jerks awake and jumps off of the raised platform, blocking your path. Various other robots do the same and start approaching your position. From behind tall machinery, several humans in white shirts in next to no armor and holding wrenches come out and join the crowd. Instead of wearing helmets, they have hard hats, a poor attempt at protection. Seems like these are the defenses Volk was referring to."""

AMR_file = """The LR 2050-SR, while a usable laser sniper that came to be adopted by the Federation's marksmen, had a critical flaw that hindered its ability to be the best long ranged weapon: power. Everyone expected that the weapon would have incredible amounts of damage but the technology to create armor piercing lasers is limited and the lasers lose a significant amount of stopping power after penetrating modern body armor. While the marksmen of the Federation put up with this due to the LR 2050-SR being leagues better than their old S2030, they still expressed complaints when going against armored targets during the war in Europa. After multiple instances where an armored target shurgged off a round from the LR 2050-SR and proceeded to kill the marksmen, the Federation created a new program, the Project Hawkeye, to create the ultimate sniping tool. However, innovation was rare and all the big names in the firearms industry failed to create a new weapon or even a new modification to the LR 2050-SR that would improve it. The Federation won the war in Europa in 2052 due to the genius of its military commanders and industrial might but the Hawkeye Program continued as the Federation poured more money into research and development. By 2053, nothing new had came about. Then, the Federation provided additional funding for the manufacturers to work together. For the first time in history, Fedtec Arms, MilSpec Defense, and Steel Weaponary, once great competitors, joined forces in a final effort to complete the Project Hawkeye. Using Vulcan Prison to do their work away from the works of the city above, the greatest researchers, scientists, and engineers of these companies decided to create an entirely new kind of weapon. Having worked together to create a new combat robot during Project Sentinal, the team used their design for a railgun. However, the challenge was the heavy and complex GI Unit's railgun and making it into a portable sniper rifle. Then, Dr. Shen of FedTec Arms made the bold move to return back to ballistic weapons, specifically 50 cal snipers of the old world. Using old schematics of these weapons, the team designed a new weapon based off of the M82A1 Barrett. The barrel would use the same principles as the railgun, meaning a series of electromagnets in the barrel accelerate a 50 calibur bullet to an incredibly high velocity. The bullet would be moved into the barrel via a primer igniting gunpowder, just like any other old world weapon. Weight was difficult to reduce but new polymer research allowed us to shave off some weight from the body. Another issue we had was with powering the railgun. On the GI Unit, a portable nuclear reactor provided all the power it would ever need. Even after dialing back the magnetic strength in the barrel, the power consumption was still incredibly high. However, a team led by Dr. Maxwell and Dr. Jones managed to create a miniture nuclear reactor that was placed in the rear of the rifle to give it power for multiple years, after which it can be replaced. In trials against Level D prisoners, the weapon proved to be extremely accurate and have a high muzzle velocity. The use of a 50 cal bullet allows for penetration through one of the sides of our T-2040 Tanks. Field testing showed that it is reliable in all conditions, including rain, mud, snow, dirt, and grass. Currently, we have named this weapon the X-50 'Volt' AMR, X meaning Experimental. We hope to introduce this weapon to the Federation Defense Force by next month."""

file_laser_rifle = """The creation of the LP-2043 Laser Pistol by FedTec Arms took the firearms industry by storm, mainly due to the hype of using laser powered weapons rather than their effectiveness. While not a perfect weapon by any means, the LP-2043 was the most accurate weapon of its time and is still renowned as a precision sidearm. After laser technology was proven to be practical for small arms, the weapons industry and many government owned research labs, including this one, began working on creating a new standard issue rifle that could also harness laser technology. The main issue during development was the build up of heat during prolonged fire at the fire rates desired of a fully automatic rifle. Initially, our lab created a prototype that reduced the overheating issue by making the rifle only semi automatic but the onset of new wars against threats in Asia and the Middle East caused the Federation to give severe backlash to such a soloution. Therefore, the teams went back to the drawing board, creating a completely new rifle from scratch. During a late night at the lab on December 10, 2046, Dr. Atlas and her assistant Dr. Powers made a ground breaking discovery that solved the overheating issue far before any other competitor. They managed to invent a new compound they called 'LiquiFreeze' which requires an immense about of heat to increase in temperature. Engineers set forth to making a weapon design that had a system of LiquiFreeze tubes and pipes that encased the firing mechanism and barrel. With this design, our lab managed to eliminate the overheating system entirely and by the following year, the Laser Rifle 2047, 7th iteration, designated LR 2047-7 was introduced to the Federation Defense Force. The LR 2047-7 proved to be an extremely capable weapon when used against all threats, foreign or domestic. It has a fire rate of 800 RPM and a battery capable of firing 50 lasers before requiring a recharge or reload. A muzzle brake is standard issue on all of these rifles to direct superheated gas from the barrel during firing upwards, creating a downward force that actively fights recoil. However, this is not a perfect system and therefore this weapon still has strong recoil, lowering its accuracy. Each rifle is also designed to come with a top rail or optical attachments and an underbarrel rail for other accessories."""

file_laser_pistol = """Throughout all of human history, ballistic weapons are perhaps the second most used class of weapons after melee weapons. They managed to reliably serve humanity in every role needed, including hunting, sporting events, property defense, and of course warfare. All firearms throughout human history were ballistic weapons firing metal projectiles propelled by the ignition of gunpowder stored in each cartridge. Countless weapon designs were created over the course of hundreds of years from a simple flintlock to fully automatic assault rifles used in the early 2000s. It appeared that this would be how all firearms would be until the end of human history. However, in 2040, as researchers at MilSpec Defense Labs were attempting to create an anti-riot laser defense system, they accidentally created an intense beam of superheated light which disintegrated the lab rats they were testing on. Seeing the potential to harness this as a new weapon, MilSpec set up a dedicated team to create a small arm with this laser technology. The result of all their three years of hard work would be the Laser Pistol 2043, designated as the LP-2043. After successful combat trials where it proved its superior accuracy and magazine capacity to conventional pistols, the Federation Defense Force ordered vast shipments of them. The key to the LP-2043's accuracy is the small diameter of its barrel. While this serves to concentrate light into a beam strong enough to cause immense damage, it also prevents the beam from scattering within the barrel. However, it is a known fact that once light enters an open space, it will diffuse, which would cause the power of the beam to diminish. This was solved by a discovery in 2042 that discovered that photons could be manipulated with magnetic power, preventing their diffision. Therefore, magnets were placed at the tip of the barrel so that right as the photons exit the barrel, they are all aligned parallel to the barrel, causing them to move directly forwards. The use of a large capacity battery allows for prolonged fire with the LP-2043 before a recharge or reload."""

file_laser_shotgun = """The successful adoption of the LR 2047-7 into standard service with the Federation Defense Force confirmed the fact that laser weapons were going to be the new focus on the weapons industry. The Federation launched a new project called Project Scatter in December 2049 to replace the aging M2010, a reliable and modular pump action shotgun. However, Enforcers from the Defense Force, upon seeing the power of laser weapons, desired a new CQC weapon that could literally melt their enemy's insides. They argued that since they fought at dangerously close ranges, being able to rapidly bring down their opponent was paramount to their survival. Angel's Arms, a new weapons manufacturer, quickly assembled a team of scientists and researchers to design a new weapon as an entry for Project Scatter. Knowing that the main draw of a shotgun was immense power at a close range, the team drew up a design used a system of mirrors to scatter a laser into a circle of eight different barrels, each harnessing the technology found in the LP-2043 and the LR 2047-7. In order to maximize the damage, the initial laser beam is passed through what the researchers called a 'Combuster' that added energy to the beam and superheated it. Of course, this required that all components of the gun be very heat resistant but the Federation's deep funding allowed for materials to not be an issue. The last issue the team faced was with overheating during rapid fire. At first, they wanted to just use the same system of LiquiFreeze pipes used in the LR 2047-7 but found that the amount of liquid and piping needed to effectively reduce overheating made the weapon too heavy. Instead, they decided to lower the rate of fire entirely, keeping the same pump action as the M2010/ The final design was entered into Project Scatter as the Close Quarters Combat 2049 Laser Shotgun and became adopted into the Defense Force as the CQC-2049L. Enforcers, eager to use it, employed the new weapon during the Federation-Europa War of 2050 to devastating effect. They almost won the war in a matter of weeks just by themselves."""

file_laser_sniper = """The final ballistic weapon to be replaced in the Defense Force's arsenal was the S2030, an accurate, light, but unreliable bolt action sniper rifle. Federation snipers and marksmen told many stories of being unable to save their comrades or kill a target due to the weapon malfunctioning at the wrong time and wrong place. Almost universally hated, the weapon remained in service when the LR 2047-7 was introduced. Quickly, marksmen and snipers attached long range optics to the LR 2047-7 and ditched the S2030 almost entirely. However, the LR 2047-7's lack of armor penetration caused massive issues against armored targets, as evidenced in the 2048 riots and the Federation-Europa War of 2050. There was a great needed for a precision rifle that was accurate, light, and reliable. This lab, the same one who developed the LR 2047-7, went straight to work developing such a weapon. Using the LR 2047-7 as a base, the team started modifying the rifle's firing mechanism to allow for armor penetration. At first, the team working on the project wanted to superheat the laser beam so that it would melt straight through armor. However, similar to the development of the CQC-2049L, the amount of LiquiFreeze and piping needed to prevent overheating made the weapon too heavy. The team went back to the drawing board for almost a month until Dr. Marco came up with a design for something he called the 'Compressor.' The design was simple. For laser weapons, each 'projectile' or 'bullet' is created by removing a certain amount of energy from the battery per shot. Therefore, Dr. Marco suggested that the weapon pulls more energy from the battery and then stores all the photons in a small chamber that is connected to a long barrel. When the trigger is pulled, a paddle quickly and forcefully compresses the photons into the barrel, adding energy to the shot that is more than enough to penetrate body armor. To give enough time for the weapon to refill the chamber, the design was bolt action, slowing down the fire rate. However, with the aim of Federation marksmen, the target would normally be dead after the first shot. Introduced as the Laser Sniper 2050, the weapon passed weapon trials with flying colors, being adopted as the LR 2050-SR. Marksmen in the war in Europa responded very favorably to the new rifle, claiming that it gives them extra accuracy based off of their confidence in it! After 2050, now all small arms in the Federation's arsenal were laser based."""
