an entire row of prison cells directly across from you, streching for at least 10 cells as far as you can see in your limited perspective. Reasonably, you assume that there is an equally long row of cells on your side as well. The hallways in the middle is dimmly lit by lights that create a 
light blue hue to the entire area. The walls of both your cell and the hallway are made of large, white tiles that, when combined with the light, create a turquoise colored environment. Despite it being a prison, you see that there is next to no trash or litter or dirt or any other kind of 
filth anywhere. The hall and the cells are immaculate. Even the uniform you are wearing and that of your fellow prisoners is spotless. A clean, orange jumpsuit combined with a white T shirt below it. On the opposite side of the bars, to your right, is a small window that lets in a small ounce 
of natural light. It is impossible to see out of it so you end up sitting on the cold, hard stone bench, likely a sad excuse for a bed. The only other thing in your cell is a white toilet. You continue to look out into the hallway as footsteps approach."""

pants continue the aesthetic trend, being black with red accents along the side of the leg. At the bottom of their legs are large, black boots. Their elbows and knees are covered with elbow and knee pads, respectively. On the hands are black gloves with more red accents. Their head is fully 
enclosed in a large black helmet that has some reflectivity in the light. One side of the helmet has a mounted flashlight. On the helmet's facepiece is a dark visor, one that is tinted so that you cannot see the person on the other side. The guard looks to their left, the cell opposite to

finger up to her lips. 'Sssshhhh, don't alert him,' she whispers. In one smooth motion, she loads one of her three arrows, draws her bow, and fires it directly into the boar. In rapid succession, she fires her other two. In less than a second, the boar goes down to the ground. The archer gives

becomes a miniture explosive which is then detonated by a small spark. The legs of the machine have been given powerful motors to allow it to close the distance between it and the opposition as fast as it can before detonation. However, multiple trials showed that maximum speed could only be 
achieved by removing almost all the armor on it, making it weak against a trained opponent and when there is a large distance to cover. Fortunately, the production of this machine is cheap and well within the allocated budget of Project Charger, making mass production very practical. The 
major concern on the current version of the Charger is its simplistic AI. It has no regard for the safety of anyone nearby, ally or enemy, and prioritizes killing its target over protecting its allies. Therefore, all allied personnel must run away from the Charger once the unit is activated. 

Addition: Government agents have reviewed the specifications, blueprints, and documentation. Our concerns about the safety of allied personnel was raised by the agents reassured us that our concerns were unnecessary. Crushing opposition is always a priority. Our design for Project Charger has
