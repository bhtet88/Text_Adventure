### Backstory ###

opening = """{0}, you have worked long and hard, preparing countless months for this journey. You know you are close to the heart of the ancient yet mysterious city of Seduco. 
Countless adventurers have lost their lives attempting to reach the treasure of the city. Legend says that thousands of years ago the Romans experimented with sorcery and alchemy 
in an attempt to find an elixer for immortality. Ancient scriptures say that in they invented divine weapons and technology during this pursuit, inventions lost in time. You have no idea
what this journey will entail or if you will even manage to come back alive. However, you know that if you find even just one of the treasures of Seduco, you will be set for life. You don't
expect to find anyone else on your journey to help you. It is just up to you, your equipment, and your wits."""

store_intro = """Before you embark on your adventure and leave the comforts of civilization, you head to the local store in order to purchase and finalize your gear. You have a backpack that can carry up to {0} lbs and
a wallet of {1} coins. Prepare wisely adventurer! Who knows when's the next time you can buy what you want?"""

### Village ### 

village_arrive = """After getting your supplies, you take a bus to a small, quiet village in the rural outskirts of the city. It's a quiet place with the villagers living simple but contentful lives. You see animals grazing off in the distance as farmers watch over them.
A group of children are playing games in the village square. Some friendly dogs join in their game, eagerly wanting to have their share of the fun as well. People are walking around the small village, going about their daily lives and ignoring your humble presence."""

village_depart = """No matter. You have everything you need for your journey. After talking with some of the locals about the legends of the ancient city, they point you to a well-trodden dirt road leading out of the village. Their eyes always widen with fear when you mention your intentions.
Many travelers have gone down this path yet none have returned. The village priest whispers his prayers for your safe return and the village elder gives you a final farewell before you trek down this path. The elder also hands you a knife and a sturdy rope, just in case."""

early_end = """You've come this far but as you look down at the village, you think about what kind of terrors previous adventurers faced. How many ran out of food and water, dying a slow and painful death? Who knows what perils are up ahead? A hostile people? Wild, aggressive animals? 
Deadly traps created by unknown people? Just thinking about these dangers makes your heart race. Life is too precious to risk your life to acquire treasures based upon mere legend. Maybe it exists, maybe it doesn't. It doesn't matter. You turn around and get back on the bus to the airport.
It's time to go home and end this chapter of your life."""

moving_forward = """Thinking about how much of your life you spent dedicated to this journey, about the fame and fortune you can get if you succeed, you turn your back on the village and move onwards. The only thing on your mind is the way forward. The air is cool and you
are excited for what awaits you. The dirt path is packed tightly, beaten down from the adventurers before you. The slight breeze causes the trees to whistle a small tune to accompany the beat of your footsteps."""

### The Wall ###

the_wall = """After about an hour and a half of walking, taking light breaks along the way, you see a misty wall in front of you. It is a very pale grey and towers over you. The only noise is that of the wind. Moving forward seems like the right option but 
you also can't help feel anxiety overcome you. Is this wall the reason why adventurers before you never came back? Is there even a way for you return once you cross this mystical shroud? You stand there in wonder, thinking about what to do next."""

wall_boomerang = """Using your mighty arms, you throw the boomerang through the mist. It glistens as the moisture engulfs it and then, it disappears. A few seconds go by, only for the boomerang to emerge from the mist. Having completed it's mission, it safely returns to your hands. You wipe
off the moisture on it but other than that, it looks just like how it did before you threw it. You then put it back into your backpack, still pondering what to do next."""

wall_rope = """The rope is nice, sturdy, and very long. You pull out a long section of rope and throw it into the mist, then drag it back out. Aside from some moisture on the parts of the rope that went into the wall, there is no damage to the rope at all. You coil the rope back up and put it
back into your backpack, contemplating what to do next."""

wall_end = """Sadly, all these thoughts are too much for you to take. The stress of being an adventurer is overbearing. If you can't muster up the strength to take a step through this shroud, how can you make it past harder obstacles? Perhaps this mist was a blessing, stopping you from 
making such a foolish mistake. You slowly walk back to the village and board a bus back to the airport. It's a sad thought to have spent so much time planning and preparing for this trip, just to turn around when the adventure just began. At least you have a home to look forward to, something
many adventurers can never say again."""

wall_onwards = """Mustering up your courage, you slowly walk towards the mist. You've made up your mind. There is no more turning back anymore! You place your right foot through the mist, then your left. Nothing feels abnormal so far. Continuing to move forwards, the mist feels 
refreshing on your skin, cleansing you of all the sweat accumulated on your trek. A few more steps and then, daylight. You feel the same as before and the forest around you looks the same as that before the wall. What was the purpose of this? How has no one discovered this before? 
Or did they discover it and perish before spreading the news? You move onwards, unaware of the perils up ahead."""

### The Forest ###

first_encounter_1 = """The bushes on your right rustle violently and you hear a distinct clinking noise coupled with the sound of footsteps on packed dirt. Slowly, a gleaming figure walks out in front of you. Clad in armor and a helmet adorned with a feather crown, he stands before you, dagger
in one hand, a massive shield in the other. Golden engravings are beautifully etched into the armor. He has a stern face but you notice something odd, very odd. This man has red eyes that pierce right through you. Before you can think about what to do, he raises right arm up into the sky."""

first_encounter_2 = """He starts moving towards you, covering himself with his shield. It's clear what this man's -- no, he's not a mere man -- Legionary's, intentions are. You said there is no turning back after crossing the mist so it's time to hold your ground and fend off this assailant."""

first_encounter_end = """The Legionary falls, his corpse making a heavy landing on the ground and kicking up small clouds of dust. Shaking, you slowly make your way to his body and examine this being. Why is there a Legionary out of all things here? Yeah sure, you are searching for ancient
Roman treasure but the Western Roman empire's army is a thing of the past. His glowing red eyes have now changed to just look like the eyes of any normal human. All over his skin are scars and features that can be best described as shallow cracks, looking like the cracks in the ground when 
there is extreme heat and no water. Aside from all this, he looks like a normal person. If this guy was so bent on killing you, there has to be something up ahead, some sort of secret, maybe even treasure! You take a few deep breaths and collect yourself together. If this was any indicator,
getting to the lost city is going to be a challenge. This forest that you are in also doesn't help. It's so dense that you find it difficult to see things that are far away. However, you walk forward with a hardened resolve, ready to take on what's up ahead. Looks like the game begins now."""

### Event dialogues ###

# Statues #

statues_intro = """You walk into a room in a bizzare condition. The walls and floor are polished and clean, aside from a few specks of dirt and grim. Two large pillars lay toppled on the ground in front of you, beautifully etched with engravings of Legionaries marching into battle and of
the Roman people celebrating a good harvest. A red carpet streches across the length of the whole room, from the entrance where you stand all the way to the exit on the other side. Just like the walls, it is also almost immaculate except for the crumbled remains of the pillars on it.
Above you, you notice that the roof has broken down for some reason, causing the sunlight to pour into the room and shower the main attractions: gigantic statues of the legendary {0}, {1}, and {2}. 

You climb over the pillars and walk in front of the statues to examine them. They are expertly crafted and have little signs of wear. It's incredible how they survived so long yet who is maintaining this room? In fact, are you the only person who has made it here? You take out your 
Latin to English dictionary and decipher the worn out messages engraved on the base of each statue. 'Place hand here to...' The rest is suspiciously worn away on each statue. Should you place your hand where it tells you too? What will happen? You stand there, wondering what to do 
as three looming giants judge you with their stone cold gazes."""

statues_exit = """Having recieved a gift from one of the statues, the text at the base of each statue fades away. You try to place your hand on their bases but nothing happens."""

mercury = """You walk up to and place your hand at the base of the statue of Mercury bent over in a sprint. An airy feeling overcomes you, making you feel as light as a feather. All the weight of being an adventurer, the stress of fending off creatures for your survival, the doubt of making it 
back home in one piece is lifted off of your shoulders. It feels as if you are merely existing but it is an enjoyable kind of existance. Gone with the worries of the world, it seems like you could just enjoy the feeling of being alive! You close your eyes to savor this moment. Slowly, 
this euphoric feeling goes away and you return to reality. You open your eyes and in front of you are a pair of chrome colored boots. You slip them on and immediately notice that they are almost weightless."""

mars = """You walk up to the towering statue of Mars in full armor and place your hand at its polished base. Suddenly, how feel your body heat up to an immense degree. It's hot, painfully hot! The sweat running down your skin feels like a knife being dragged through your skin! You start jumping 
and skipping about the room, intensely wiping off your sweat and screaming at the pain. You close your eyes, you want to die and end this suffering. However, the pain suddenly stops. You open your eyes and gasp for breath. What just happened?! You check your entire body yet there are no signs
of damage and all your clothes have dry as ever. You are relieved. However, you also feel an incredible power inside of you now. It courses through every vessel in your body and you feel stronger than ever."""

apollo = """You walk up to the statue of Apollo singing gracefully with his lyre and place your hand at its base. The one quiet room starts to fill with the sound of ancient Roman singing, slowly becoming louder and louder. A playful rhythm accompanies a steady beat and lyrics about the wonders
of Roman life. The voices sing of a wonderful harvet and plentiful hunt, thanking the Gods for their mercy and blessings. The mystical bard moves on to tell of the glory of the Roman military, how graceful the men march into battle and the mercy they show their foes. The focus then turns to
life in the city, encapsulating with descriptions of the town square, the political discussions occuring in the Senate, and the cheers of the crowd in the Colusseum. The music flows all around you and uplifts your spirit, making it as full of joy as the melody itself. You close your eyes to
turn inwards and fully imagine what the song is saying. Then, the voices and music slowly fade away and you are left in the silence of the room once more. Upon opening your eyes, you find a beautiful lyre in front of you, a treasure for you to keep."""

vejovis = """You walk up to the statue of Vejovis holding pilums standing next to a goat and place your hand at its base. You feel a quick rush of energy overcome you but then it quickly dissipates. However, when you take a drink of your water, you feel more refreshed than you were expecting. 
The same feeling occurs when you try eating a snack from your backpack. Everything you consume invigorates you with more energy than ever before. """

diana = """You walk up to the statue of Diana, crouched aiming her bow, and place your hand at its base. Immediately, you notice a whistle come from behind you and you whip around, ready to take on another foe. However, what was once a white room has now become an expansive forest. You turn
back around to face the statue but that's gone as well, replace by more tall trees and short shrubs. You turn around once more, hearing a rustling in the bushes behind you. Out of the shrubs jumps a large, fat boar that immediately starts grazing in front of you. You don't know what you 
should do. That thing has the speed and strength to rip your guts out with its tusks. Despite being frozen, you notice out of the corner of your right eye a graceful and silent archer crouching next to you. She has a finely crafted bow in hand but no quiver in sight. She sees you and puts her
finger up to her lips. 'Sssshhhh, don't alert him,' she whispers. In one smooth motion, she loads one of her three arrows, draws her bow, and fires it directly into the boar. In rapid succession, she fires her other two. In less than a second, the boar goes down to the ground. The archer gives 
you her thanks for staying quiet and goes forth to secure her kill. The forest vanishes around you and the room returns back to normal. You feel as if you learned something valuable from that experience: how to use a bow to its full potential. A skill that you think will come in handy."""

# Legendary Items #

legit_intro = """You encounter a worn down gray stone wall with a human skeleton peacefully resting on it, sitting on the ground with its back on the cold stone. Something tells you that this skeleton has been sitting here for years as time rolled by. Surprisingly, there is still a hat
perched on its head, a worn down jacket on its torso, and trousers on its legs. You check the canteen lying nearby. No water. No food either, probably eaten by the occupants of this place or nature's own animals. There are so many ways this person could have perished. Maybe its your mind
placing you in the skeleton's shoes but you imagine that this brave and foolish soul stopped moving forward for whatever reason. No more food, water, equipment, willpower, or whatever it may be. You imagine that they just sat down in this room, resting their back on this wall. Perhaps they
cried or thrashed around in anger and frustration. Eventually, they made peace with the idea of death and slowly let their life slip away from them. At least, that is how you would like to die, accepting the end of your life if it came down to this."""

ross_rifle_text = """You notice that the skeleton was craddling something in its arms, almost like a baby. You gently and respectfully slip it out of the skeleton's arms. Brushing off the dust and polishing it a bit with a rag, you find that it's bolt action rifle in a usable condition. You
operate the bolt, pulling it back and sliding it forward once again. It still feels incredibly smooth and a little grease would make it flawless. There are still some bullets left in the chamber of the rifle. You throughly inspect the rifle and determine that while old, it is still a usable
machine. However, this is not just any rifle. It's the Ross Rifle, legendary Canadian bolt action rifle renowned for its accuracy and power! It became known after its performance with Canadian troops during the Great War, becoming a precision weapon in the hands of a skilled user. If only
there was a scope you could attach to this. That would make this the perfect rifle."""

you were here to push on, to move towards the treasure. You summon up all your courage and run through this paranormal scene as fast as you can, dashing out of the room until its exit was out of your sight. Exhausted from that sprint, you lean back on a rock and catch your breath, collecting
youself back together. All you think about is that this treasure better be damn worth it!"""
