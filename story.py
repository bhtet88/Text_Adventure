an entire row of prison cells directly across from you, streching for at least 10 cells as far as you can see in your limited perspective. Reasonably, you assume that there is an equally long row of cells on your side as well. The hallways in the middle is dimmly lit by lights that create a 
light blue hue to the entire area. The walls of both your cell and the hallway are made of large, white tiles that, when combined with the light, create a turquoise colored environment. Despite it being a prison, you see that there is next to no trash or litter or dirt or any other kind of 
filth anywhere. The hall and the cells are immaculate. Even the uniform you are wearing and that of your fellow prisoners is spotless. A clean, orange jumpsuit combined with a white T shirt below it. On the opposite side of the bars, to your right, is a small window that lets in a small ounce

pants continue the aesthetic trend, being black with red accents along the side of the leg. At the bottom of their legs are large, black boots. Their elbows and knees are covered with elbow and knee pads, respectively. On the hands are black gloves with more red accents. Their head is fully 
enclosed in a large black helmet that has some reflectivity in the light. One side of the helmet has a mounted flashlight. On the helmet's facepiece is a dark visor, one that is tinted so that you cannot see the person on the other side. The guard looks to their left, the cell opposite to

life in the city, encapsulating with descriptions of the town square, the political discussions occuring in the Senate, and the cheers of the crowd in the Colusseum. The music flows all around you and uplifts your spirit, making it as full of joy as the melody itself. You close your eyes to

back around to face the statue but that's gone as well, replace by more tall trees and short shrubs. You turn around once more, hearing a rustling in the bushes behind you. Out of the shrubs jumps a large, fat boar that immediately starts grazing in front of you. You don't know what you 
should do. That thing has the speed and strength to rip your guts out with its tusks. Despite being frozen, you notice out of the corner of your right eye a graceful and silent archer crouching next to you. She has a finely crafted bow in hand but no quiver in sight. She sees you and puts her
finger up to her lips. 'Sssshhhh, don't alert him,' she whispers. In one smooth motion, she loads one of her three arrows, draws her bow, and fires it directly into the boar. In rapid succession, she fires her other two. In less than a second, the boar goes down to the ground. The archer gives 
you her thanks for staying quiet and goes forth to secure her kill. The forest vanishes around you and the room returns back to normal. You feel as if you learned something valuable from that experience: how to use a bow to its full potential. A skill that you think will come in handy."""

No matter, this experience was a wonderful one. It's a shame that whatever is left of the Roman empire is trying to kill you. Perhaps you might have enjoyed living in this society. Slowly, the sounds and sights fade away, along with the guests. You are left by yourself, with only your

advance!' At that moment, the ranks behind the front line of Legionaries placed their shields above their heads, forming an inpenetrable fortess of Roman might. They unit slowly creeped towards the barbarians, their shields fending off the arrows. On their flanks, their auxilliary archers
peppered the enemy. When they clashed with the barbarian warriors, the Legionaries showed their skill and strength, cutting down their foes and whittling the enemy's numbers. A charge from their cavalry finished off the survivors, leaving the Romans the victors. You are in awe of their

charger_file = """The Charger is the first combat machine developed in the Labs, the first iteration of a long line of machine research. It arose from the need to field quick, disposable support for frontline troops and for riot control purposes. Chief Researcher Otto developed the concept of 
a suicide robot powered by a small diesel engine. Upon getting close to a target, the machine's software overrides all safety and cooling systems for the engine. By allowing the engine to reach an extremely high internal pressure and by preventing the escape of air inside of it, the engine 
becomes a miniture explosive which is then detonated by a small spark. The legs of the machine have been given powerful motors to allow it to close the distance between it and the opposition as fast as it can before detonation. However, multiple trials showed that maximum speed could only be 
achieved by removing almost all the armor on it, making it weak against a trained opponent and when there is a large distance to cover. Fortunately, the production of this machine is cheap and well within the allocated budget of Project Charger, making mass production very practical. The 
major concern on the current version of the Charger is its simplistic AI. It has no regard for the safety of anyone nearby, ally or enemy, and prioritizes killing its target over protecting its allies. Therefore, all allied personnel must run away from the Charger once the unit is activated. 

Addition: Government agents have reviewed the specifications, blueprints, and documentation. Our concerns about the safety of allied personnel was raised by the agents reassured us that our concerns were unnecessary. Crushing opposition is always a priority. Our design for Project Charger has 
been given the green light to proceed.
