### Backstory ###

opening = """{0}, you have worked long and hard, preparing countless months for this journey. You know you are close to the heart of the ancient yet mysterious city of Seduco. 
Countless adventurers have lost their lives attempting to reach the treasure of the city. Legend says that thousands of years ago the Romans experimented with sorcery and alchemy 
in an attempt to find an elixer for immortality. Ancient scriptures say that in they invented divine weapons and technology during this pursuit, inventions lost in time. You have no idea
what this journey will entail or if you will even manage to come back alive. However, you know that if you find even just one of the treasures of Seduco, you will be set for life. You don't
expect to find anyone else on your journey to help you. It is just up to you, your equipment, and your wits."""

store_intro = """Before you embark on your adventure and leave the comforts of civilization, you head to the local store in order to purchase and finalize your gear. You have a backpack that can carry up to {0} lbs and
a wallet of {1} coins. Prepare wisely adventurer! Who knows when's the next time you can buy what you want?"""

### Village ### 

village_arrive = """After getting your supplies, you take a bus to a small, quiet village in the rural outskirts of the city. It's a quiet place with the villagers living simple but contentful lives. You see animals grazing off in the distance as farmers watch over them.
A group of children are playing games in the village square. Some friendly dogs join in their game, eagerly wanting to have their share of the fun as well. People are walking around the small village, going about their daily lives and ignoring your humble presence."""

village_depart = """No matter. You have everything you need for your journey. After talking with some of the locals about the legends of the ancient city, they point you to a well-trodden dirt road leading out of the village. Their eyes always widen with fear when you mention your intentions.
Many travelers have gone down this path yet none have returned. The village priest whispers his prayers for your safe return and the village elder gives you a final farewell before you trek down this path. You take one final look at civilization, wondering if this was the right choice."""

early_end = """You've come this far but as you look down at the village, you think about what kind of terrors previous adventurers faced. How many ran out of food and water, dying a slow and painful death? Who knows what perils are up ahead? A hostile people? Wild, aggressive animals? 
Deadly traps created by unknown people? Just thinking about these dangers makes your heart race. Life is too precious to risk your life to acquire treasures based upon mere legend. Maybe it exists, maybe it doesn't. It doesn't matter. You turn around and get back on the bus to the airport.
It's time to go home and end this chapter of your life."""

moving_forward = """Thinking about how much of your life you spent dedicated to this journey, about the fame and fortune you can get if you succeed, you turn your back on the village and move onwards. The only thing on your mind is the way forward. The air is cool and you
are excited for what awaits you. The dirt path is packed tightly, beaten down from the adventurers before you. The slight breeze causes the trees to whistle a small tune to accompany the beat of your footsteps."""

### The Wall ###

the_wall = """After about an hour and a half of walking, taking light breaks along the way, you see a misty wall in front of you. It is a very pale grey and towers over you. The only noise is that of the wind. Moving forward seems like the right option but 
you also can't help feel anxiety overcome you. Is this wall the reason why adventurers before you never came back? Is there even a way for you return once you cross this mystical shroud? You stand there in wonder, thinking about what to do next."""

wall_boomerang = """Using your mighty arms, you throw the boomerang through the mist. It glistens as the moisture engulfs it and then, it disappears. A few seconds go by, only for the boomerang to emerge from the mist. Having completed it's mission, it safely returns to your hands. You wipe
off the moisture on it but other than that, it looks just like how it did before you threw it. You then put it back into your backpack, still pondering what to do next."""

wall_end = """Sadly, all these thoughts are too much for you to take. The stress of being an adventurer is overbearing. If you can't muster up the strength to take a step through this shroud, how can you make it past harder obstacles? Perhaps this mist was a blessing, stopping you from 
making such a foolish mistake. You slowly walk back to the village and board a bus back to the airport. It's a sad thought to have spent so much time planning and preparing for this trip, just to turn around when the adventure just began. At least you have a home to look forward to, something
many adventurers can never say again."""

wall_onwards = """Mustering up your courage, you slowly walk towards the mist. You've made up your mind. There is no more turning back anymore! You place your right foot through the mist, then your left. Nothing feels abnormal so far. Continuing to move forwards, the mist feels 
refreshing on your skin, cleansing you of all the sweat accumulated on your trek. A few more steps and then, daylight. You feel the same as before and the forest around you looks the same as that before the wall. What was the purpose of this? How has no one discovered this before? 
Or did they discover it and perish before spreading the news? You move onwards, unaware of the perils up ahead."""
